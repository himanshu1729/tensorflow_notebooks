# TensorFlow Notebooks

In these notebooks, I have implemented various Machine Learning Models for Learning TensorFlow.




To run them, you also need the latest version of TensorFlow. To install it:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

or (if you want GPU support):
```
pip install tensorflow_gpu
```

For more details about TensorFlow installation, you can check [TensorFlow Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
